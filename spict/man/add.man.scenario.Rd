}
\details{
\subsection{Default management scenario}{
The default management scenario is fish at \eqn{F_{MSY}}. This is when
\code{ffac}, \code{cfac}, \code{fabs}, \code{cabs} are all \code{NULL}, and
\code{breakpointB} and \code{safeguardB$limitB} are 0. In practice \code{ffac}
is set equal to \eqn{F_{MSY}/F_m}.
}

\subsection{Catch scenarios}{
Management scenarios can be defined based on a desired catch during the
management period. Common examples include scenarios like "increase catch by
25%", "keep current catch", or "zero catch". The catch can be relative to the
predicted "previous catch", using the multiplier \code{cfac}, or in absolute
terms using \code{cabs} catch in the same units as the input data. By default,
the respective previous catch corresponds to that part of the previous
year which corresponds to the management interval. For example,
if the management period is \eqn{[1991, 1992[}, the
whole catch from the year \eqn{[1990, 1991[} is being used. If the
management period is \eqn{[1991.5, 1991.75[}, the same interval from the
previous year \eqn{[1990.5, 1990.75[} is being used. If the management
period spans several years, e.g. \eqn{[1991, 1993[}, the whole catch from
the previous year \eqn{[1990, 1991[} is being used two times.
}
\subsection{Harvest Control Rules (HCRs)}{

The combination of the arguments "fractiles", "breakpointB", and
"safeguardB" allow the specification of a number of different harvest control
rules:

\itemize{
\item{MSY hockey-stick rule: Fishing at F_{MSY} above a certain biomass reference
    level (here defined as a fraction of B_{MSY} with \code{breakpointB}).
    Below the reference level, fishing is reduced linearly to 0 as suggested in
    ICES (2017).}
\item{MSY (hockey-stick) rule with additional precautionary buffer: As long
    as the probability of the predicted biomass relative to a reference
    biomass level (e.g. 0.3 B_{MSY}, defined by \code{safeguardB$limitB}) is smaller or
    equal to a specified risk aversion probability (e.g. 95%, defined by
    \code{safeguardB$prob}), fishing at F_{MSY} or following the hockey-stick rule
    (if \code{breakpoint != 0}), otherwise reduce fishing mortality to meet
    specified risk aversion probability (\code{safeguardB$prob}) as introduced in
    ICES (2018).}
\item{By ICES (2019) recommended MSY hockey-stick rule with 35th percentiles:
    Fishing at 35th percentile of F_{MSY} above the 35th percentile of 0.5
    \eqn{B/B_{MSY}} (\code{breakpointB = 0.5}) and 35th percentile of
    linearly reduced F_{MSY} below the 35th percentile of 0.5
    \eqn{B/B_{MSY}}. TAC corresponds to 35th percentile of predicted catch.
    Rule is applied with \code{fractiles = list(catch=0.35, bbmsy=0.35,
    ffmsy=0.35)}, \code{breakpointB = 0.5}, and \code{safeguardB =
    list(limitB = 0, prob = 0.95)}.}}
}
\subsection{Fractiles}{
By default, the median (fractile of 0.5) is used for the stock status (\eqn{B/B_{MSY}},
\eqn{F/F_{MSY}}) and predicted catch distribution. A more precautionary
approach is to used fractiles lower than the median (0.5) to account for the
estimated uncertainty. The arguments of the `fractiles` are:
\itemize{
\item{catch - Fractile of the predicted catch distribution}
\item{bbmsy - Fractile of the \eqn{B/B_{MSY}} distribution}
\item{ffmsy - Fractile of the \eqn{F/F_{MSY}} distribution}}

Note that the fractile for the \eqn{F/F_{MSY}} distribution is 1 minus the
fractile specified. As the current fishing mortality is divided by the value
of this distribution \eqn{F{y+1} = \frac{F_y}{F_y/F_{MSY}}}, a lower
percentile of the \eqn{F/F_{MSY}} distribution is more conservative than a
larger one. This allows a consistent setting of fractiles among the different
quantities.
}

\subsection{Biomass safeguard}{
The argument list "safeguardB" includes:
\itemize{
\item{limitB - Reference level for the evaluation of the predicted biomass
  defined as fraction of \eqn{B/B_{MSY}}. By default (\code{safeguardB$limitB
  == 0}) the PA buffer is not used. Theoretically, any value smaller than 1
  is meaningful, but an ICES recommended value would be 30%
  \code{safeguardB$limitB = 0.3} (ICES, 2018).}
\item{prob - Risk aversion probability of the predicted biomass relative to
  specified reference level (\code{safeguardB$limitB}) for all rules with PA
  buffer (\code{safeguardB$limitB != 0}). Default: 0.95 as recommended by ICES
  (2018).}}
}
\subsection{Intermediate period assumptions}{
Dependent on the start of the management period (e.g. advice year), there
might be a time lag between the last observation and the start of the
management period, often referred to as the intermediate period. If this is
the case, an assumption about the catch during intermediate time period (e.g.
assessment year) has to be made. Two meaningful assumptions are:

\itemize{
\item{1: }{The catch in the intermediate period is based on the fishing
mortality which is extrapolated from the previous year. This is the default
assumption;}
\item{2: }{The catch in the intermediate period is directly specified. This
could for example be the TAC recommended in the previous year. The catch can
be specified by means of the argument \code{intermediatePeriodCatch}. Be
aware that this catch might correspond to several years or a fraction of a
year depending on the time between the last observation and the start of the
management period. The function \code{\link{man.timeline}} can help
visualising the default or specified intermediate period in your data. The
argument \code{intermediatePeriodCatchSDFac} allows to specify the factor
with which to multiply the standard deviation of the catch (\eqn{\sigma_C})
with. It is thus a measure of the certainty around the catch in the
intermediate period. The argument \code{intermediatePeriodCatchList} allows
to define a list with catches and their intervals. It is a list with the
elements 'obsC', 'timeC', 'dtc' and the optional element 'stdevfacC' (which
is equal to 1 if not provided).}}
