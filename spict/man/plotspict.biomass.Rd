\description{
Plot estimated biomass.
}
\details{
Plots estimated biomass, Bmsy with confidence limits.

If no management scenarios are included in \code{rep$man}, the grey vertical
line corresponds to the time of the last observation. If management scenarios
are included in \code{rep$man}, the prediction and confidence intervals of
the base scenario (\code{rep}) are omitted and instead the projections of the
different management scenarios are drawn in different colours. Dotted lines
of the management scenarios reflect the intermediate period, while solid
lines reflect the management period. Additionally, two vertical lines
correspond to the start and end of the management period.
