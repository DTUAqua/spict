\description{
Fits the model using the TMB package and returns a result report containing estimates of model parameters, random effects (biomass and fishing mortality), reference points (Fmsy, Bmsy, MSY) including uncertainties given as standard deviations.
}
\details{
Model parameters using the formulation of Fletcher (1978):
\itemize{
  \item{"logn"}{ Parameter determining the shape of the production curve as in the generalised form of Pella & Tomlinson (1969).}
  \item{"logm"}{ Log of maximum sustainable yield.}
  \item{"logK"}{ Log of carrying capacity.}
  \item{"logq"}{ Log of catchability vector.}
  \item{"logsdb"}{ Log of standard deviation of biomass process error.}
  \item{"logsdf"}{ Log of standard deviation of fishing mortality process error.}
  \item{"logsdi"}{ Log of standard deviation of index observation error.}
  \item{"logsdc"}{ Log of standard deviation of catch observation error.}
}

Unobserved states estimated as random effects:
\itemize{
  \item{"logB"}{ Log of the biomass process given by the stochastic differential equation: dB_t = r*B_t*(1-(B_t/K)^n)*dt + sdb*dW_t, where dW_t is Brownian motion.}
  \item{"logF"}{ Log of the fishing mortality process given by: dlog(F_t) = f(t, sdf), where the function f depends on the choice of seasonal model.}
}

Other parameters (which are only needed in certain cases):
\itemize{
  \item{"logphi"}{ Log of parameters used to specify the cyclic B spline representing seasonal variation. Used when inp$nseasons > 1 and inp$seasontype = 1.}
  \item{"logU"}{ Log of the state of the coupled SDE system used to represent seasonal variation, i.e. when inp$nseasons > 1 and inp$seasontype = 2.}
  \item{"loglambda"}{ Log of damping parameter when using the coupled SDE system to represent seasonal variation, i.e. when inp$nseasons > 1 and inp$seasontype = 2.}
  \item{"logsdu"}{ Log of standard deviation of process error of U_t (the state of the coupled SDE system) used to represent seasonal variation, i.e. when inp$nseasons > 1 and inp$seasontype = 2.}
  \item{"logsde"}{ Log of standard deviation of observation error of effort data. Only used if effort data is part of input.}
  \item{"logp1robfac"}{ Log plus one of the coefficient to the standard deviation of the observation error when using a mixture distribution robust toward outliers, i.e. when either inp$robflag = 1 and/or inp$robflagi = 1.}
  \item{"logitpp"}{Logit of the proportion of narrow distribution when using a mixture distribution robust toward outliers, i.e. when either inp$robflag = 1 and/or inp$robflagi = 1.}
}

Parameters that can be derived from model parameters:
\itemize{
  \item{"logr"}{ Log of intrinsic growth rate (r = 4m/K).}
  \item{"logalpha"}{ Proportionality factor for the observation noise of the indices and the biomass process noise: sdi = exp(logalpha)*sdb. (normally set to logalpha=0)}
  \item{"logbeta"}{ Proportionality factor for the observation noise of the catches and the fishing mortality process noise: sdc = exp(logbeta)*sdf. (this is often difficult to estimate and can result in divergence of the optimisation. Normally set to logbeta=0)}
  \item{"logBmsy"}{ Log of the equilibrium biomass (Bmsy) when fished at Fmsy.}
  \item{"logFmsy"}{ Log of the fishing mortality (Fmsy) leading to the maximum sustainable yield.}
  \item{"MSY"}{ The yield when the biomass is at Bmsy and the fishing mortality is at Fmsy, i.e. the maximum sustainable yield.}
}

The above parameter values can be extracted from the fit.spict() results using get.par().

Model assumptions
\itemize{
  \item{"1"}{The intrinsic growth rate (r) represents a combination of natural mortality, growth, and recruitment.}
  \item{"2"}{The biomass B_t refers to the exploitable part of the stock. Estimates in absolute numbers (K, Bmsy, etc.) should be interpreted in light of this.}
  \item{"3"}{The stock is closed to migration.}
  \item{"4"}{Age and size-distribution are stable in time.}
  \item{"5"}{Constant catchability of the gear used to gather information for the biomass index.}
