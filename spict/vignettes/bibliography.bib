    journal = {ICES Journal of Marine Science},
    year = {2019},

    abstract = "{The productivity of fish populations varies naturally over
                  time, dependent on integrated effects of abundance, ecological
                  factors, and environmental conditions. These changes can be
                  expressed as gradual or abrupt shifts in productivity as well
                  as fluctuations on any time scale from seasonal oscillations
                  to long-term changes. This study considers three extensions to
                  biomass dynamic models that accommodate time-variant
                  productivity in fish populations. Simulation results reveal
                  that neglecting seasonal changes in productivity can bias
                  derived stock sustainability reference levels and, thus,
                  fisheries management advice. Results highlight the importance
                  of biannual biomass indices and their timing relative to the
                  peaks of the seasonal processes (i.e. recruitment, growth,
                  mortality) for the estimation of seasonally time-variant
                  productivity. The application to real-world data of the
                  eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) stock shows that the model
                  is able to disentangle differences in seasonal fishing
                  mortality as well as seasonal and long-term changes in
                  productivity. The combined model with long-term and seasonally
                  varying productivity performs significantly better than models
                  that neglect time-variant productivity. The model extensions
                  proposed here allow to account for time-variant productivity
                  of fish populations leading to increased reliability of
                  derived reference levels.}",
