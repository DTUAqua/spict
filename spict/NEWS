spict v1.3.0 (Release date: 2020-02-20)
============

New features:

* New variables to control management related quantities: 'maninterval' and
 'maneval' which replace the variables 'timepredc', 'dtpredc', and 'manstart'
* New management functionality (see updated section in manual for full
  functionality), including:
  - New scenario 'ices' in manage
  - new function add.man.scenario to add customised scenarios
  - get.TAC to estimate TAC
  - man.timeline to visualise management times
  - many more
* plot2 selection of the 4 plots: relative Biomass, relative F, catches, Kobe
  plot

Minor changes:

* new defaults for Bl, Fl and Co, and Bp, Fp and co

Bug fixes:

* indlastobs considers end of catch (and effort) interval
* new default values of management related variables fix inconsistent default
  values for seasonal data


spict v1.2.8 (Release date: 2019-12-02)
============

New features:

* Added new vignette: "Guidelines for the use of the stochastic production model
  in continuous time (SPiCT)"
* Added helper function `calc.bmsyk` that returns the Bmsy / K ratio of a fitted
  object
* Added helper function `calc.om` that return a matrix with the order of
  magnitude of the confidence interval range of F/Fmsy and B/Bmsy
* Added helper function `shorten.inp` that cuts the input time series to the
  specified range
* Added option for gamma distributed prior for the parameter determining the
  shape of the production (`n`) curve on the log scale
* Added option to report the states in terms of biomass and fishing mortality
  relative to the overall average over the whole time series (including the
  prediction period) `Brel` and `Frel`, respectively

Minor changes:

* Added sdfac argument in `manage` that sets the standard deviation factor keep
  current catch scenario
* Increased maximum number of iterations and function evaluations of the
  `nlminb` optimiser
* Increased tested code coverage

Bug fixes:

* Use non seasonal F in `manage`
* Use better default value for the standard deviation factor in `take.c`
* Remove inverse gamma priors which were not fully functional


spict v1.2.7 (Release date: 2019-04-03)
============

New features:

* Added new management scenario: ICES MSY advice rule
* Added NEWS file

Minor changes:

* Updated documentation for check.inp and spict2DLMtool
* Makefile now takes the version number from DESCRIPTION file
