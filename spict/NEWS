============

New features:

* Added new vignette: "Guidelines for the use of the stochastic production model
  in continuous time (SPiCT)"
* Added helper function `calc.bmsyk` that returns the Bmsy / K ratio of a fitted
  object
* Added helper function `calc.om` that return a matrix with the order of
  magnitude of the confidence interval range of F/Fmsy and B/Bmsy
* Added helper function `shorten.inp` that cuts the input time series to the
  specified range
* Added option for gamma distributed prior for the parameter determining the
  shape of the production (`n`) curve on the log scale
* Added option to report the states in terms of biomass and fishing mortality
  relative to the overall average over the whole time series (including the
  prediction period) `Brel` and `Frel`, respectively

Minor changes:

* Added sdfac argument in `manage` that sets the standard deviation factor keep
  current catch scenario
* Increased maximum number of iterations and function evaluations of the
  `nlminb` optimiser
* Increased tested code coverage

Bug fixes:

* Use non seasonal F in `manage`
* Use better default value for the standard deviation factor in `take.c`
* Remove inverse gamma priors which were not fully functional
