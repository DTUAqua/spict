spict v1.3.0 (Release date: 2020-02-25)
============

New features:

* New management section in SPiCT handbook
* New variables to control management related quantities: 'maninterval' and
 'maneval' which replace the variables 'timepredc', 'dtpredc', and 'manstart'
* New defaults for Bl, Fl and Co, and Bp, Fp and co
* New management functionality (see updated section in manual for full
  functionality), including:
  - New management scenario 'ices' in `manage()`
  - New function `add.man.scenario()` to add customised scenarios to `rep$man`
  - New function `get.TAC()` to estimate TAC of specified scenario
  - New function `man.tac()` to estimate TAC of all scenarios in `rep$man`
  - New function `man.timeline()` to visualise management times in form of a timeline
  - New function `sumspict.manage()` to print summary of all scenarios
  - New function `check.man.time()` to check and correct model times in respect to management times
  - New function `man.select()` to select certain scenarios from `rep$man`
* New function `plot2()` allowing to plot a selection of 4 important plots:
  relative Biomass, relative F, catches, and the Kobe plot
*

Minor changes:

* retape function
* make.man.inp function -> include former predcatch, prop.F
* streamline functionality of `manage()` -> all scenarios use
  `add.man.scenario()`
* Updated guidelines vignette
* intermediate period possible for all scenarios
* verbose argument in all management functions
* New test scripts for all management-related functions
* `manage()` overwrites all scenarios in `rep$man`
* manbase scenario removed
* dF and dB in management summary output only shown if all scenarios have the
  same timeline
* DLMtool dependent functions removed

Bug fixes:

* indlastobs considers end of catch (and effort) interval
* new default values of management related variables fix inconsistent default
  values for seasonal data
* Allow retro to function with effort data


spict v1.2.8 (Release date: 2019-12-02)
============

New features:

* Added new vignette: "Guidelines for the use of the stochastic production model
  in continuous time (SPiCT)"
* Added helper function `calc.bmsyk` that returns the Bmsy / K ratio of a fitted
  object
* Added helper function `calc.om` that return a matrix with the order of
  magnitude of the confidence interval range of F/Fmsy and B/Bmsy
* Added helper function `shorten.inp` that cuts the input time series to the
  specified range
* Added option for gamma distributed prior for the parameter determining the
  shape of the production (`n`) curve on the log scale
* Added option to report the states in terms of biomass and fishing mortality
  relative to the overall average over the whole time series (including the
  prediction period) `Brel` and `Frel`, respectively

Minor changes:

* Added sdfac argument in `manage` that sets the standard deviation factor keep
  current catch scenario
* Increased maximum number of iterations and function evaluations of the
  `nlminb` optimiser
* Increased tested code coverage

Bug fixes:

* Use non seasonal F in `manage`
* Use better default value for the standard deviation factor in `take.c`
* Remove inverse gamma priors which were not fully functional


spict v1.2.7 (Release date: 2019-04-03)
============

New features:

* Added new management scenario: ICES MSY advice rule
* Added NEWS file

Minor changes:

* Updated documentation for check.inp and spict2DLMtool
* Makefile now takes the version number from DESCRIPTION file
