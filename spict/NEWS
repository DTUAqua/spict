spict v1.2.8 (Release date: 2019-09-23)
============

New features:

* get.prod.regimes() - Function for the calculation of AIC for spict
  models with different break points for the productivity regimes.
* shorten.inp() - Function that allows to shorten the input data to
  any specified time interval.
* remove.priors() - Function to remove all or any specified prior(s)
  from the input list.
* calc.bmsyk() - Function to calculate the B_{MSY}/K ratio which
  allows to evaluate if the spict assessment approaches the limits of
  a meaningful production curve.
* calc.om() - Function to estimate the order of magnitude of the 95\%
  confidence intervals of estimated reference levels. Large order of
  magnitudes (> 1 order of magnitude) can indicate insufficient input
  data or violation of model assumptions.
* change.euler() - Function that allows to change the time step of the
  Euler time discretisation of the input list.
* check.euler() - Function to evaluate the sensitivity of assessment
  results (in particular of estimated reference levels) to the Euler
  time step.

Minor changes:

* The stamp (and associated plotting window) is created before the
  main plot in all plotting functions. This allows to make any
  additions (lines, points, annotations, etc) to any spict plot
  (except multiplots).

Bug fixes:

* Print effort observations if included in inp when using
  check.inp. Print survey indices only if included in inp.
