## SPiCT data file
##
## Commercial catches must be assigned a time INTERVAL given by "time_start" and "time_end"
## and must have fleet number 1.
##
## Indices of exploitable stock biomass are assumed to be snapshots in time, so "time_start" should equal "time_end" 
## (If not, the midpoint is used). Allowed fleet numbers are 2 to 998. Separate catchabilities and variances are estimated for each fleet number.
##
## Total commercial effort may be provided, and should have fleet number 999.
##
## The column "obs" contain the actual observations. Only positive values are used.
##
## Relative observation weights may be provided in the column "stdevfac". 
## The standard deviation of observation error (on log scale, which is approximately the CV) is assumed to be proportional to this number.
