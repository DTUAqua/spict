spict
=====

An R-package for fittng surplus production models in continuous-time to fisheries catch data and biomass indices (either scientific or commercial). Main advantages of spict are:

1. All estimated reference points (MSY, Fmsy, Bmsy) are reported with uncertainties.

2. The model can be used for short-term forecasting and management strategy evaluation.

3. The model is fully stochastic in that observation error is included in catch and index observations, and process error is included in fishing and stock dynamics.

4. The model is formulated in continuous-time and can therefore incorporate arbitrarily sampled data.

## Package requirements

The package requires [`TMB`](http://www.tmb-project.org) to be installed. TMB is now a part of CRAN and can therefore be installed using the install.packages() command. For more information about TMB click [`here`](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp).

## Installing the spict package

To install spict from GitHub use

```
library(devtools)
install_github("mawp/spict/spict")
```

Note for Windows users
-------
Installation in Windows requires that Rtools is installed, which is probably the case if TMB is installed. If not, Rtools can be obtained [`here`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
